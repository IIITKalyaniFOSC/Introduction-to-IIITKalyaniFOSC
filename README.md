# Introduction to IIITKalyaniFOSC

## What is this?

Being in college having only Computer Science and Engineering is one of our biggest advantage. We all are learning various programming languages for year(s) now and most of us are comfortable in them. The problem is very few of us are actually implement what we learn. Just seeing video lectures and reading books is not a way to code. We have to actually start building small projects and try our own ideas in whatever we learn. These projects will help us to develop many skills including actual thought processes towards problem-solving.

By creating this organisation, we are trying to acheive the same objective. No one is a senior here and no one is a junior. We all are trying to quench our thirst to code.
So are you ready for this journey towards learning professionalism in coding!!!

## How this will work?

Our organisation will also work in a way most of the developers and companies work. It will also focus on  quality group discussions,develop analytical skill set and the ability to explain your problem and be responsive.
There will be only two official ways to communicate:

- Github - https://github.com/IIITKalyaniFOSC

- Slack - https://iiitkalyanifosc.slack.com/signup

Slack will be the only offcial way to communicate.

Everyone has to register with a slack account and we will make proper groups according to projects to communicate with the team members.

## What projects?

- FOSC Website
- Papervault
- Design Jam(competition)

## What should I do now?

- __Create GitHub__ account(In case you are reading with your friend's ID)

- Join __slack__ channel.

- In the '__#intro__' channel, introduce yourself in short with your coding background. You also have to mention your GitHub account link which is required to add you to this organisation.

- After this you will be added to GitHub of IIITKalyaniFOSC in span of 1 day after verification.

- The most important thing you should know is 'Git'. So start learning about git, github and all those confusing terms. Here are the some resources you will surely love:
