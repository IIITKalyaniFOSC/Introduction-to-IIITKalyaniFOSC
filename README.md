# Introduction to IIITKalyaniFOSC

## What is this?

Being in college having only Computer Science and Engineering is one of our biggest advantage. We all are learning various programming languages for year(s) now and most of us are comfortable in them. The problem is very few of us are actually implementing what we learn. Just seeing video lectures and reading books is not a way to code. We have to actually start building small projects and implement our own ideas in what you We learning. This projects will help to build up many skills including actual thinking process to solve certain problem.

By creating this organisation, we are trying to acheive same thing. No one is senior here and no one is junior. We all are trying to solve one common problem.
So be ready for this journey!!!

## How this will work?

Our organisation will work in a way most of the developers and companies work. This will also give us qualities like group discussions, ability to explain your problem and be responsive.
There will be only two official ways to communicate:

- Github - https://github.com/IIITKalyaniFOSC

Slack will be only offcial way to communicate.

Everyone has to register to slack account and will make proper groups according to projects to communicate with team members.

## What projects?

- FOSC Website
- Papervault
- Design Jam(competition)

## What should I do now?

- __Create GitHub__ account(In case you are reading on your friend's)

- Join __slack__ channel.

- In the '__#intro__' channel, introduce yourself in short with your coding background. You also have to mention your GitHub account link which is required to add you to this organisation.
